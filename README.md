# Auto-Clicker
This is an auto-clicker, written in Python, for Windows systems. It's still a work in progress and nothing is final.

## Features
Simulates clicks on a given window by providing the window name, click speed, and you set the click position by selecting a button on the GUI and then clicking where you want the auto-clicker to click.
